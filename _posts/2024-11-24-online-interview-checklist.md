obvious yet here to mention them explicitly.  
check off as one go.  
simple distraction free checklist.  
basically for my sister.  

<input type="checkbox"> Keep pen and paper ready  
<input type="checkbox"> Keep a water bottle filled  
<input type="checkbox"> Put phone on silent  
<input type="checkbox"> Plug in your laptop for charge.  
<input type="checkbox"> Test mic & camera angles  
<input type="checkbox"> Close all unnecessary browser tabs. Let only interview ones in context  
<input type="checkbox"> Keep your phone's hotspot on to connect.  
<input type="checkbox"> Tell people around  
<input type="checkbox"> Login 5 mins early.  
<input type="checkbox"> Speak out few toungue twisters if it helps.  
<input type="checkbox"> Get a big smile, it's contagious.  
<input type="checkbox"> Greet them first, make the first move.

enough ice melt to carry over smooth.

Warm wishes.
