Write.  

lately it has been tough managing info overload.  
so much info around, getting everything everywhere all at once.  
but the priority at EOD remains to be the amount of info  
that i would meaningfully ingest in me. 
writing, be it even in draft state  
helps me with crystallizing thoughts.  
i encourage you to experience it.

i write,  
to improve my own clarity of thoughts.  
this space remains mostly geared towards this.  
nonetheless, things we read here would resonate with most of you as well.
visit often - talk ideas - we might sync great and end up to be good friends!  
  
i write,  
it slows me down to put all,  
but it feels worth to invest time for things that matters dear to me.
putting out ideas on stage fires up those sleepy neurons  
which may remain sleepy if i am the only one who looks at these thoughts.  
  
i wish to be intellectually more active.  
bit tired of slop content around my social media feeds and  
been trimming out ruthlessly for a while.
i want to increase my threshold of focus,  
this is my way of attempting to do so.  
  
just start.  
at this point, i dont know if it ends up to be one liner or a mini-essay 
nonetheless, i'm more inclined to start writing something,
something i would like to revisit,
something i wish to keep in my journey,
something that clears up my cluttery brain, perhaps.
  
i got bit of success  
at few of my instagram captions
mostly rants and bits, but okay enough to engage myself.  
looking back, they did help quite a bit.  
for organising thoughts, to think around something,   
albeit random ones.  

good enough i guess.
see you around.
