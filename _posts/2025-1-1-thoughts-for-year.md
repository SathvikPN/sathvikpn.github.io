as i look back 2024,  
few things i look forward for active chase in 2025.  

- health foundations. pull push squat mobility balance run sweat cook-a-bit
- mental cool. think-and-do bit clear has non-linear gains.
- sit through lock-ins. extra hours rabbit-holes new-thoughts
- reciprocate lot with AI. read more to ask better questions.
- time is the equalizer. pick better things to pass-through-time.
- thought-tokens are valuable. put it somewhere easier to readback. 
- reserve headspace for your people. fight help laugh learn. but spend time.
- read people thought-flows. write yours. grow thick to take mock, pick learnings and keep moving forward.

abstract thoughts. here to register the thoughtflow.
gets better as things translate into action more often.
see you around.
