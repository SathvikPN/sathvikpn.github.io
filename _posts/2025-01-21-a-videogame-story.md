beside beast beauty - Lamborghini Aventador.    
straight outta NFS-MostWanted game-verse feels.    
    
back in the days,     
Rs.30/hr cybercafe games, luxurious event.    
vice-city game 1hr, brag about what we did in gamecity - whole day.    
nag installation guy to get miniclip games approved by parents.    
pentium processor PC build, enough for lite load.    
    
shashank, guy who used to get pocket money,     
put all to buy NFS-MW from same cybercafe (Rs250 ig),     
burned into CD.    
we were playing it, talking about it.     
then their family moved to new town.    
he brought the game to me.    
    
one summer, family's friend-family came over from BLR,     
chandan & yashwant,     
elders but were earliest guys     
who shared same craze for hollywood action movies.    
i remember watching transformers in craze at HBO channel,    
full of heavy metallic bass sounds - so many shushs from parents.    
i used to silence police scream-offs during police bounty missions,    
they showed how maps are memorized and comms are listened for police plans,    
they played games at that level,     
and shared their BLR campus stories of mini-militia strategies,    
i was at awe!    
    
they left - then i began blacklist career. (until then challenge series in NFS, one-at-time)    
hooks by game devs, 15 feels good,     
but then onwards, i got moments that feels im just not built for this game.    
some police-evade missions took 2 to 3 hours,     
yet if missed few seconds or if electricity went off,    
whole mission has to restart,     
frustrations were mad real.    
police heat-levels just builds up,     
cross 5, helicopter chases.    
with helicopter on tail,     
theres just few cooldown spots, to reach without notice and evade.    
    
it turned good that i didnt got cheat-codes or mods of NFS,    
vice-city with cheat codes was no more exciting.    
    
then some life happened, sidelined all-asking game.    
    
it resurfaced again at PU days,    
my college finish by afternoon 2pm if lab, else by 12pm.    
either i had nap or started to play random one-off races.    
but as you know,     
madness is like gravity,    
i tried few blacklist career race, bang, im chasing game again.    
couple of months, had continuous afternoon sessions,    
had couple of challenge races left and was at blacklist 2 ig,    
wanted to finish game and get glory,     
but life got bit serious,    
exam scores were down, the local tuition was tiring,    
wanted to give up all trainings and study on my own at my pace,    
i needed decent score to convince parents that i could give-up tuitions.    
so, NFS-MW halted, near to end - yet unfinished.    
    
But there wasnt FOMO, i was glad i had crazy time and     
was abnoxiously scared that if i goofed up at my boards,    
im gonna suffer bigtime, for fun of game-time.     
late realisations - but it was shit scary.    
but late was late,     
math had a fighting chance, learning chapter-end formulas -     
atleast could give a try, deriving in answer booklet itself.    
chem was brutal, without completing syllabus,     
no chance to predict any answer, damn.    
phy and bio was okay, bit interested in them, so.    
    
thenafter, didnt picked any game with allheart.    
pubg was hit at engineering,    
but then, i owned,    
- low-end phone and     
- fear that i might get sucked into game    
    
i conciously was trying to do something with my time, away from this.    
if only was that great at chasing goals, haha.    
i folded.     
exam-prev day stress used to build up,    
as a cope, i used to transfer all data from my 3GB/64GB phone to laptop     
get pubg data folder in android and play few games.    
was a noobie, and still noobie till date.    
    
strange joy, when saw this supercar IRL,    
that color is cherry-on-top.    
a smooth slide to daydream for a while - the 'danza kuduro' moment!    
    
PS: 'danza kuduro' is the bgm song of fast-and-furious (fast-five) movie climax scene.    
remember when roman brags his new car, theres only 4 in world, 1 in western hemisphere,    
and tej calmly shows that he drives one and says its 2 now!
