i often wondered what to snack.  
most of time it would be random ones.  
going out ride to eat something has become the norm.  
masalpuri to bajji to masal mandakki to bread bonda  
there's quite a few.   
occasional is okay,  
i want something intuitive to be part of my mainstream.  

few years back,  
i had been following few,  
looking over, they still remains to be my favourite ones.
